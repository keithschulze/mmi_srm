# Image Reconstruction
So we have a list of localisations, how do we get a pretty picture to put in an paper?

Could just use a dot at each location, but that doesn't look very realistic or pretty. Another option that is used fairly commonly is a small Gaussian for intensity or some similar shaped function.

Perhaps the most realistic version is to use the data extracted from the Gaussian fitting for each of our localisations.
