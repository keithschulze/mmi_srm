## A note on single-molecule localisation analysis
It's tempting to postulate that one could derive quantitative data such as the absolute number of molecules or molecule stoichiometry from the single-molecule localisation data and there are some interesting projects being undertaken in this regard. However, there are some important biological considerations, particularly with respect to STORM, which complicate matters:
* For STORM in particular, each secondary antibody has several fluorophores attachedâ€”Lifetech specify that there are 6-8 Alexa molecules attached to each of there secondary antibodies. This uncertainty in the number makes it difficult if not impossible to accurately determine the actual number of antibodies let alone molecules that are bound in a sample.
* More generally, however, the biggest uncertainty associated with single-molecule localisation techniques like STORM is the number of fluorophores that are actually excited. Some estimates put this at <50% of molecules ever being excited, but this could vary with preparation and imaging conditions.
